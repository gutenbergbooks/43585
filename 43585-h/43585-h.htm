<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> whatever direction you may travel,&mdash;north,
south, east, or west,&mdash;you will doubtless
meet some of your little black-eyed Jewish
cousins. They live among us here in America.
They also dwell in the countries far away across
the wide ocean.</p>

<p>Why are they so scattered, you may ask.
Is there no country which is really theirs, and
which is ruled over by some one they have
chosen? Is there not some place where they
can gather together happily whenever they
please? The answer is always no.</p>

<p>They cannot say of this land or of that,
"It is ours," for they are homeless. Palestine,
which was once theirs, is now in the
hands of the Turks. Jerusalem, the city they
love best in the whole world, is in the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of those who look with scorn upon the Jewish
people.</p>

<p>For many centuries they have been scattered
far and wide. Their children learn to speak
the language of the country where they happen
to be born. They play the games and
dress in the fashion of that country.</p>

<p>What is it that keeps them Jews? It is
their religion, and their religion alone. It
binds them as closely together now as it did
in the days when they worshipped in the great
temple at Jerusalem, two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>These Jewish cousins would say to us,
"Our people have suffered greatly. Yet they
do not lose courage. Our parents tell us
stories of the glorious past, over and over
again. They will not let us forget it, and they
teach us to hope for the time when Jerusalem
will again be ours, and a new temple, in which
we shall be free to worship, will stand upon
the spot where the old one was destroyed."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<div class='adtitle2'>Our Little Jewish Cousin</div>




<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE PLACE OF WAILING</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Come</span>, Esther! Come, Solomon! I am
waiting for you," cried a woman's voice.</p>

<p>The two children were in the courtyard,
but, when they heard their mother calling,
they ran into the house at once.</p>

<p>They knew why they were called, for it was
Friday afternoon. Every week at this time
they went to the "Place of Wailing" with
their parents to weep over the troubles of
their people and to think of the old days
of Jerusalem, before the Romans conquered
the city.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Esther, your hair needs brushing. Solomon,
make your hands and face as clean as
possible," said their mother, as she looked
at the children.</p>

<p>She loved them very dearly. She was
proud of them, too. Solomon was a bright,
clever boy, quick in his studies, while Esther
was really beautiful. Her glossy black hair
hung in long curls down her back. Her
black eyes were soft and loving. Her skin
was of a pale olive tint, and her cheeks were
often flushed a delicate pink.</p>

<p>Her mother looked tenderly at her as she
brushed the little girl's hair.</p>

<p>"Mamma, grandma says I look ever so
much as you did when you were my age,"
said Esther, as she trudged by her mother's
side down the narrow street.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my child, I have heard her say
so. But never mind your looks or mine now.
Think of where we are going."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a hot walk. The sun was shining
brightly. The street, the stone houses, everything
around shone dusty gray in colour.
There were no sidewalks. When a camel
drew near with his load, or a horseman passed
by, Esther had to walk close to the walls of
the houses for fear the animals would rub
against her.</p>

<p>She was born in this old city of Jerusalem.
She had never been far away from it, and knew
little of the wide streets and broad sidewalks
found in many other cities.</p>

<p>She had sometimes heard her father and
mother talk of their life in Spain. They came
from that country before Esther and her
brother were born. It was a long journey,
but they had said, "We cannot be happy
anywhere except in Jerusalem. That alone is
the home of our people."</p>

<p>Esther's father might have grown rich in
Spain. He was a trader. He understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his business well. But in Jerusalem it was
harder for him to get money.</p>

<p>What a strange name for the place where
the family were going this afternoon! But it
well deserved to be called "The Place of
Wailing." It was a dark, dreary court with
stone walls on three sides of it. Many Jews
were already there when Esther and her
people arrived.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="men at the wailing wall" />
<div class="caption">"IT WAS A DARK, DREARY COURT WITH STONE WALLS
ON THREE SIDES OF IT."</div>
</div>

<p>Some of them were seated on the ground.
They were weeping bitterly and rocking their
bodies to and fro. Others, with sad faces,
were reading from the Hebrew Bible. Still
others were kissing the wall and bumping it
with their foreheads. Some parts of the rock
had actually been worn smooth by the lips of
those who had come here week after week and
year after year. For they really believed it
was a part of the old temple wall.</p>

<p>Little Esther, with her glossy black curls,
did just what she saw the others do. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
tears began to fall from her eyes as she went
close up to the wall and kissed the cold gray
stone.</p>

<p>Did all of these people really feel as bad
as they seemed to do? Certainly. For they
were grieving that Jerusalem was no longer
great and no longer theirs. It was now in the
hands of the Turks, but, long before they
came, the Romans had taken the city from
the Jews, after a long and bitter fight.</p>

<p>Saturday is the Jewish Sabbath. It is
their holy day, and the time when they rest
from work. On Friday afternoon they begin
to prepare for the Sabbath. Hundreds of the
Jews in Jerusalem gather at the Place of
Wailing at that time. They not only weep
and read from their Bible, but they also pray
to the Lord to take their country out of the
hands of their enemies and give it back to
them.</p>

<p>As Esther walked home she looked up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the mosque of Omar. It is the Turks'
grandest place of worship in the city. Her
father told her that it stands on the very spot
where Solomon's wonderful temple was built.</p>

<p>"That temple was the most beautiful one
ever seen by men," said the Jew. "Its brightness
was enough to dazzle the eyes of those
who looked upon it. Its walls were plated
with gold. The very gate was golden.</p>

<p>"A beautiful golden vine, with clusters of
grapes as large as a man's body, was draped
over the gate. The floor was paved with
gold. Golden lilies were carved upon the
pillars and mouldings.</p>

<p>"There was no door. But there was a
reason for this. It was to show that the
heavens are always open. They are closed to
no one."</p>

<p>"And now, papa, nothing is left of that
beautiful building," said Esther.</p>

<p>"Not one stone, my dear. But we Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
all hope the time will come when it will be
rebuilt."</p>

<p>"It was not the first temple which was
destroyed by the Romans when they took
Jerusalem, was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. The second temple had been
standing in its place for hundreds of years at
that time. It was wonderfully beautiful, too.
Herod the Great spent vast sums of money
on it. It was the wonder of every one who
looked upon it. But our enemies destroyed
it, as you well know."</p>

<p>That evening, while Esther and her brother
sat by their father's side, he told them the
story of the destruction of Jerusalem and of
the brave men and women who tried to
save it.</p>

<p>The Jews had feared for some time that
something dreadful would happen. They had
seen strange visions. While the feast of the
Passover was taking place, the great temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was filled with a light like that of noonday.
And this happened at the ninth hour of the
night.</p>

<p>Something else quite as wonderful as this
took place. The bronze door of the Gate
Beautiful opened of itself at the sixth hour of
the night. Yet this very gate was so heavy
that twenty men could scarcely move it, even
when the great iron bolts had been drawn.</p>

<p>Esther looked up at her father with surprised
eyes as he told of these things. But
when he spoke of seven chariots that drove
across the sky, and of the armies the frightened
people saw in the clouds, she was still more
astonished.</p>

<p>"I should think our soldiers would have
lost courage before they were attacked," she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not so, Esther. But listen, my child, as
I describe the mighty Roman army that soon
drew near Jerusalem. Multitudes of Syrians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had joined them, and these led the way as they
came marching up the heights.</p>

<p>"Titus, the Roman general, followed the
Syrians. The spearmen came with him. Next
came the legions with their terrible short
swords and the trumpets that filled the air
with word of their approach.</p>

<p>"Every footman among the Romans was
armed with a sword, a lance, and a shield.
Besides these, he carried with him a saw, axe,
hook, pickaxe, and enough food to last him
for three days. The horsemen were also furnished
with everything they needed for battle
or for a long siege.</p>

<p>"This great army steadily drew nearer and
nearer. Do you think the brave soldiers
guarding our city trembled with fear as they
looked forth from the watch-towers and saw
them?"</p>

<p>"Not so, father. A Jew fears nothing."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. But now, let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
return to Jerusalem as she stood then. A
triple wall, thirty feet high, had been built
around the city, except where it was separated
from the rest of the country by deep ravines.
One wall was quite enough to protect it in
such places. Many watch-towers had been
set up around the city. It seemed impossible
to take it by surprise at any point.</p>

<p>"The temple stood on Mount Moriah in
all its glory. But it was not a temple alone.
It was also a strong fortress."</p>

<p>"How could the Romans take the city,
even if their numbers were so great?" asked
Solomon.</p>

<p>"They could never have won, except for
one thing. Our people were not wholly
united. A party of them under the high
priest, Ananus, felt there was no hope. They
believed it would be wisest to give up at once
and make peace.</p>

<p>"But the others said, 'No, we will fight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the end, and will drive our enemies from the
city.' If every one had felt from the first
as these did, all would have been well. It
was too late when the different parties agreed
to work for one end.</p>

<p>"The Romans threw immense stones into
the city. They cut down the trees in all the
country round, and made towers from which
they hoped to fire and destroy the buildings
inside the walls.</p>

<p>"They succeeded, for they soon made an
opening in the outer wall. Then the second
wall gave way before the mighty force. And
all this time those Romans, who were stationed
across from the city on the Mount of Olives,
were throwing such huge stones from their
great engines that the houses and people
inside Jerusalem were being destroyed, both
by day and by night.</p>

<p>"Worse still! they began to lack food and
to suffer from starvation. They could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
hold out much longer. The time soon
came when the last wall was broken down
and Titus marched through the streets of the
city.</p>

<p>"It was very strange that it was the anniversary
of the day when the first temple was
destroyed by the soldiers of Babylon.</p>

<p>"'It is on fire! The glorious temple is
burning!' cried our people, as they saw the
flames. A Roman soldier had kindled the
fire without the knowledge of Titus, who had
not wished to injure this wonder of the whole
world.</p>

<p>"Some of the priests threw themselves into
the flames. Before it was destroyed, Titus,
with his captains, entered the holy place.
The Roman general cried, 'It is more beautiful
than I even imagined. Its riches are a
perfect marvel.'</p>

<p>"The golden candlesticks and tables and
cups, the sweet spices of which the priests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
made incense, the precious stones, were laid
at the feet of the conqueror."</p>

<p>"What did he do with all this wealth?"
asked Esther.</p>

<p>"He carried most of it back to Rome.
But he rewarded the bravest of his soldiers
with crowns of gold and chains of silver.</p>

<p>"He had fought for many days before
Jerusalem gave up. In that time the country
around us had been ruined. The forests had
been cut down for the making of engines of
war. The herds of cattle had been killed to
furnish food for the army of Titus. The
harvests had been gathered for the same purpose.
As for the people themselves, more
than a million were killed and the rest were
made the slaves of the Romans."</p>

<p>"Don't feel bad, papa," said Esther, lovingly.
"That was a very long time ago."</p>

<p>"Yes, Esther, but our people have been
scattered over the world ever since then. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
shall never be happy till we are once more
the rulers of this city."</p>

<p>"Mother told me a story, the other day,"
said Solomon, who had not spoken for a long
time. "It was about a family who lived here
when Titus appeared before our gates. I
think she told it to make me brave."</p>

<p>"What is the story, Solomon?" asked his
father.</p>

<p>"There was a brave man in our city. He
was of noble blood and true to his faith.
He had a faithful wife and seven sons. You
shall hear how brave and true they were.</p>

<p>"The Roman army began the terrible siege.
Before it was over, the brave noble was killed,
but his wife and children lived. After Titus
entered the city, he heard of this family. He
ordered them to be brought before him.</p>

<p>"As they stood in his presence he spoke
to each in turn. He offered them freedom
if they would give up their faith and bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
down before his gods. But not one of them
hesitated. They had not a single thought of
giving up their faith in the one living God.
No, not for the sake of life.</p>

<p>"One by one they were led away to death.
At last, only the youngest son was left before
the conqueror. Titus was moved to pity for
the beautiful boy. He really wished to save
him. He said, 'My child, see! I will drop
my ring for the sake of the gods. If thou
wilt pick it up, thy life shall be spared.'</p>

<p>"The boy looked up at him firmly. He
answered, 'It shall lie there where you dropped
it. I am afraid of no living man. I fear only
the thought of life without the One God.'"</p>

<p>"Of course, he followed his brothers. But
what became of the mother?" asked Esther.</p>

<p>"She begged to die with her sons. She
said Abraham had built one altar on which to
sacrifice to God. She had built seven! And
she spoke truly."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a noble story of noble people," said
the children's father. "There were many
like them in that old time. Let us hope
there are still many in the world."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GAZELLE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Shall</span> I help?" asked Solomon.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. Take the seeds in the skirts
of your coat and come along," was the answer.</p>

<p>Solomon and Esther were visiting some
friends in a village near Jerusalem. It was the
month of December and the time to plant the
crops in Palestine.</p>

<p>"After we have scattered the grain," Solomon's
friend Levi said, "the camel shall help
us plough the ground. Then the seed will
take care of itself."</p>

<p>It did not surprise Solomon to hear of a
camel drawing a plough.</p>

<p>Levi's camel was as useful to him as horses
are to farmers in America. Solomon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Esther had been at their friend's many times
when the great, slow, clumsy animal helped
his master about the farm and garden.</p>

<p>"He isn't handsome, but I love the dear
old fellow," said Levi. "He is more patient
than most camels. I know he is slow beside
some of his fellows, but he cannot help that."
Levi stroked the camel's head.</p>

<p>"There, see! He likes to have me notice
him as well as my new pet."</p>

<p>The camel bent his head down toward his master,
with a look that said as plainly as words,
"I love you, master, for you are kind to me."</p>

<p>"What is the new pet, Levi?" asked
Solomon.</p>

<p>"When I get through my sowing, you may
go into the house and call Esther. Then you
two shall see it together."</p>

<p>Solomon could hardly wait for Levi to finish
his work. But at last the seeds were all
scattered.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't go at the ploughing just yet. I
am tired, and it is warm. We will rest awhile.
I know you are anxious to find out what I
have to show you. I got it for my wife,
Rebecca."</p>

<p>Levi was a young man and had been married
only a short time. He was very fond of
his pretty wife, and liked to have surprises for
her. He led the way to the house where
Esther was talking with Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Solomon wishes to see our new pet," he
said. "Have you told Esther about it?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. We will all go together,"
answered the young Jewess.</p>

<p>They went out to the stable and Levi pointed
to a bed of straw over in the corner. There
something lay curled up and sound asleep.</p>

<p>"It's a gazelle. Oh, what a beauty!" cried
Esther. "It's only a baby still."</p>

<p>"I never saw such a little one before," said
Solomon. "May I take it up in my arms?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The gazelle waked up at the sound of
voices. It opened its soft, dark eyes with
a frightened look.</p>

<p>"It is very shy," said Rebecca. "But we
pet it so much it will soon get over its fear.
You children ought to see it run and frolic
with me."</p>

<p>"Here, little one, come and eat," said the
gazelle's mistress, in a low, sweet voice.</p>

<p>It sprang up and started toward Rebecca.
But, when it had come half-way, it became
frightened again at the sight of the visitors.
The food looked too tempting, however, and
it came to Rebecca's side.</p>

<p>"I believe no other animal has as beautiful
eyes as the gazelle. It is certainly the most
graceful of all creatures," said Levi.</p>

<p>"See how white its breast is!" said Esther.
"The dear little thing! Mayn't I hold it for
just a minute?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebecca was very fond of Esther and her
brother. She loved to have them visit her.
She picked up the gazelle and put it in the
little girl's lap as soon as she had seated herself
on a pile of straw.</p>

<p>Esther patted the gazelle tenderly. "It is
better than any doll. I wish I had one of
my own. I should love it dearly."</p>

<p>"I cannot stop any longer now," said Levi.
"My old camel is wondering why I don't
go to work. Are you coming with me,
Solomon?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am," answered the boy, and
the two started for the field.</p>

<p>"What shall we do with ourselves?" asked
Rebecca, when she and Esther had been left
alone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what you would like," she
went on. "We will go over into our neighbour's
orchard. He is gathering olives, and
we will watch him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would like that ever so much," answered
her little visitor.</p>

<p>It took them only a few minutes to
get to the olive orchard. The owner and
his sons were heating the branches with long
sticks, and knocking off the fruit to the
ground. Two women were busily at work
gathering the olives in baskets. As soon
as a basket was filled, it was carried away
and emptied, and then brought back to be
filled again.</p>

<p>It was surprising how quickly the women
gathered their loads. Then away they would
step with their baskets on their heads, walking
as easily and gracefully as though they were
free of all burdens whatever.</p>

<p>"Come on and help us," they cried to
Rebecca and Esther. "The more at work
the merrier we shall be. There are two empty
baskets under that tree."</p>

<p>The visitors were soon busy trying to see if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
they could fill their baskets as quickly as the
others did.</p>

<p>"I am not tempted to eat the olives," said
Esther. "They are too bitter. But I am
very fond of them after they are pickled."</p>

<p>"So are we all," answered one of the
women. "I don't know how we should get
along without olives and the oil we make from
them."</p>

<p>"They say the Christians not only eat that
unclean animal, the pig, but they also use its
fat for cooking, just as we use olive oil," said
Rebecca.</p>

<p>"Ugh! What a horrid idea. I should be
afraid to eat anything in the house of a Christian,
for fear of being poisoned," cried Esther.
"Mamma has told me they sometimes die
of diseases we Hebrews never have. It is
probably because they eat pork and use lard."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, Esther," answered Rebecca.
"It is a wise law of our religion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
forbids us to eat any food obtained from the
hog."</p>

<p>"We must not stop to talk too much,
though. See! our friends are getting ahead
of us."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said for some time.</p>

<p>"It is surprising how quickly we finished,"
said one of the women to Rebecca, as the last
basket was emptied. "It is because our friends
gave us so much help. Won't you come to
the house with us now and have a luncheon?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," answered Rebecca. "It
is nearly supper time, and I must go home
and do some cooking."</p>

<p>"I am anxious to see the dear little gazelle
again," said Esther.</p>

<p>As she walked back to her friend's house
Rebecca told her stories about wild gazelles.</p>

<p>"They like to keep together," she said.
"They are very fond of each other's company.
While they are feeding, one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
stands on guard to see if any enemies are
stealing upon them. If he hears a sound that
means danger, he gives the alarm and away
the flock flees like the wind."</p>

<p>"I have often heard father speak of being
as fleet as a gazelle," said Esther. "But
what are its worst enemies?"</p>

<p>"The lion and the leopard, I suppose.
Poor little creature! If a lion takes it by
surprise, there is little hope for its life. Its
only chance is in flight.</p>

<p>"There are times when less dangerous
animals come upon a herd of gazelles, and
then they make a stand to defend themselves.
They gather in a close mass, with the mothers
and little ones in the centre. The males make
a ring on the outside, pointing their horns
toward the enemy."</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful they should be so wise?
How did you learn so much about gazelles,
Rebecca?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Levi told me. But I must hurry now
to get supper. We are going to have something
nice."</p>

<p>Rebecca was a good cook. Although
Esther was quite hungry from being out-of-doors
so much, it did not seem very long
before a roast goose and a dish of onions
were steaming on the supper table.</p>

<p>"It is ready just in time, Levi," said his
wife, as her husband and Solomon came into
the house.</p>

<p>"I am quite tired, but the smell of the
supper is enough to make me forget all about
it. Tired as I was, though, I stopped to feed
my faithful camel."</p>

<p>"How old is he?" asked Solomon.</p>

<p>"My father had him before he was six
months old, and that was twenty years ago.
I was a little fellow just toddling about
then. So, you see, the camel and I grew up
together."</p>

<div class="caption">LEVI AND HIS CAMEL.</div>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is no wonder you love him, Levi,"
said Solomon. "I don't believe I ever saw a
baby camel."</p>

<p>"Isn't it hard work training a camel to
obey you, and to kneel at your command?"</p>

<p>"Father said he had to use a great deal of
patience at first. The camel kicked and
fought and grumbled before he could be made
to bend his knees. Even now, he scolds a good
deal about obeying, as you children know."</p>

<p>"Esther and I saw a camp of Bedouins
on our way here," said Solomon. "They
were tending a flock of beautiful sheep. One
of the shepherds was holding a new-born
lamb in his bosom."</p>

<p>"Those fierce Bedouins are tender to their
flocks, but cruel to men," said Levi. "You
cannot trust them for a moment. They look
down upon us village people. But in our
hearts we scorn them."</p>

<p>"They are dreadful thieves," said Rebecca.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"When I was up in Jerusalem, the other
day, I heard a story about a Bedouin woman
who went last summer into a rich man's garden.
The owner of the place was just coming
into the entrance when he met the woman
with a basket of lettuce on her head. She was
a relation of one of his servants. He stopped
and asked her several questions about her
errand there. She told him she had just been
to his place to try to sell her lettuce, but she
could not do it, as the garden contained all his
family could use.</p>

<p>"The gentleman supposed she was telling
the truth. What was his surprise, then, when
he found out after she was safe out of sight
that the woman had stolen every head of
lettuce out of his garden!"</p>

<p>"It is just like the deceitful creatures,"
said Levi. "I dislike the sight of them."</p>

<p>"Are you going to have much honey this
year?" asked Solomon.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have several swarms of bees, and
I hope they will do well."</p>

<p>"It won't be long before we shall have
some fresh honey," said Rebecca. "Then
you children must pay us another visit, for I
know you like sweet things."</p>

<p>"I wish we didn't need to go home to-morrow.
But mother said we mustn't stay
here any longer this time. By and by,
though, there will be more wild flowers to
pick, and I had rather be here then. I love
to get big bunches of tulips and poppies and
trim the house with them."</p>

<p>"How many red flowers we have here in
Palestine!" said Rebecca.</p>

<p>She did not know that Christian travellers
from other parts of the world speak of them
as the "Saviour's Blood Drops." They are
sure to notice the fields dotted with brilliant
scarlet flowers.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to tell you a story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
King Solomon?" asked Levi. "Your speaking
of the honey and the flowers put it into
my mind."</p>

<p>"Of course we do," said both children.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. It is about the visit
of the Queen of Sheba with her generals and
armies. As she approached, the great king
received her sitting on his throne in that
wondrous palace of which you have heard
so much.</p>

<p>"'Is he as wise as people say?' the queen
said to her attendants. 'I will find this out
for myself.'</p>

<p>"Now it happened that her subjects were
noted for their skill in making artificial flowers.
Those who made it their business to study
flowers could not tell the difference between
real ones and these imitation ones, they were
so perfect.</p>

<p>"The queen decided to test King Solomon's
wisdom in this matter. She ordered two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
beautiful wreaths to be prepared. One was
to be made of real flowers and the other of
artificial ones. Taking the two wreaths in her
hands, she presented herself before the king.</p>

<p>"'Choose one of these for yourself,' she
said.</p>

<p>"There seemed to be no choice as to which
he would take, although he looked at them
closely. But his wise mind told him there
must be some difference. The birds and
insects could tell him which one to take. He
looked out of a window and saw honey-bees
in the garden below. Then he knew what
to do. He ordered the window to be opened.
The breeze carried the odour of the flowers
out to the bees and they came flying into
the room.</p>

<p>"You can easily guess they alighted on the
wreath of real flowers. The artificial ones did
not attract them in the least. Then Solomon
spoke.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The bees have told me which wreath
to choose,' he said."</p>

<p>"The Queen of Sheba found out that the
king was truly wise, didn't she?" said
Solomon.</p>

<p>"Yes, Solomon, and you who are named
for him should always remember what the
Queen of Sheba learned,&mdash;that there is one
thing worth more than riches or beauty."</p>

<p>"And that is wisdom," said Rebecca, softly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the first evening of the seven days
set apart to celebrate the deliverance of the
Jews from their bondage in Egypt and their
safe passage to a new home of their own.</p>

<p>Solomon and Esther were dressed in their
Sabbath clothes. So were their father and
mother. The house was trimmed as though
for a wedding.</p>

<p>"Is the table ready?" Esther's mother
asked the servant.</p>

<p>"Quite ready. Everything is in its place, I
think," was the answer.</p>

<p>The children's father led the way, and the
family gathered around the table. There
were lettuce and cress, unleavened bread, wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and a meat bone which was carefully covered
with a fine cloth.</p>

<p>Solomon and his father began to chant.
They rocked themselves to and fro at the
same time. This motion of their bodies was
to express as well as possible the words of the
psalm, "All my bones shall praise thee."</p>

<p>When the chant was finished, the master of
the house cut a slice from a loaf of bread
shaped like a crescent.</p>

<p>"These two pieces of bread," he said,
solemnly, "are like the shores of the Red
Sea. But now, as I join them together again,
it seems as though we could see the waves
sweeping over Pharaoh's host."</p>

<p>He then took one-half the loaf and, putting
it in a napkin, tied it on Solomon's shoulders.
There it remained till the ceremony was over.
Everybody drank some wine, and then another
chant was sung. After that, they ate
some lettuce and jam and chanted again.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Esther's father now took some bread,
spread it with jam, wrapped it in lettuce
and wound cress around it. He gave some
of it to each one to eat. This was done in
memory of the ten plagues of Egypt.</p>

<p>The service was not finished until every one
had eaten eggs. This was a sign of mourning
that their temple had been destroyed.</p>

<p>Solomon and Esther understood the meaning
of all that was done this evening. They
had been carefully taught the history of the
"Chosen People," as they liked to call themselves.
But at this festival their father once
more repeated many of the stories of the
olden time.</p>

<p>He said, "We do not celebrate this festival
exactly as our forefathers did. They always
sacrificed a lamb. They were also careful to
eat no leavened food for the whole seven days.
We follow the rule about unleavened bread
still, and we look upon the first and last days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as holy. You must never do labour of any
kind on these two days."</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell the story of the
first Passover, and how Pharaoh, as the ruler
of Egypt was called, wished to keep the
Hebrews in bondage. He was building two
treasure-cities, and he needed great numbers
of workmen to make the bricks. He did
not wish the Hebrews to join his enemies
or leave the country.</p>

<p>He was a stern ruler, and he made his
slaves work very hard. Yet they had many
children. The Pharaoh did not like this.
He feared they would become too powerful.
So he ordered that every new-born boy among
them should be killed.</p>

<p>It happened at this time that a little boy
was born in a family where there were already
two children. This new baby was a boy, and
was given the name of Moses. The mother
of the child was fearful lest he should be discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and killed by the cruel Pharaoh. She
hid him as best she could for three months.
Then she thought: "The danger grows
greater every day. I must make some new
plan to save him."</p>

<p>She placed the baby in a little cradle or ark,
and carried him down to the shore of the
river, where she hid him in the reeds. She
told her daughter Miriam to stay near her
brother and watch over him. Then she went
away.</p>

<p>A little while after this, who should come
but the noble princess, Pharaoh's daughter.
She was going to bathe in the river. It was
not long before she spied the smiling baby
in the bulrushes. She was so pleased with the
little fellow that she said, "I will adopt the
child."</p>

<p>Then the little Miriam came to her side
and told the princess she knew of a good
nurse. In this way it came about that Moses'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
own mother was hired to take care of the
baby.</p>

<p>As he grew up in the king's palace, his
mother told Moses all about himself and
his people. He was very carefully taught,
and soon showed that he was "mighty in
words and deeds."</p>

<p>It happened one day that Moses saw one
of the overseers cruelly beating an Israelite.
He was so angry that he killed the overseer.
Then he had to flee to save his own life
from the wrath of Pharaoh. He went into
the desert not far from the Red Sea, and there
he stayed for forty years.</p>

<p>He became a shepherd. Once while he
was tending his sheep, he saw a strange sight.
It was a burning bush. That in itself was
nothing to wonder at. But the strange part
of it all was that the bush looked as though it
were in flames, yet it did not really burn up.
It was a sign from Heaven!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>As Moses looked at the bush, he heard a
voice. It cried, "Take off your shoes, for you
are standing on holy ground."</p>

<p>He listened in wonder as he next received
a command from God to seek the ruler of
Egypt, who was now treating the people of
Israel with great cruelty. He must give the
Pharaoh a message. It was this,&mdash;that God
commanded Moses to lead the people of Israel
out of Egypt and into the desert.</p>

<p>At first Moses feared to do this. But the
Lord caused some miracles to be performed
before his eyes. Then he had faith, and became
brave enough to do as God commanded
him.</p>

<p>He went with his brother Aaron to the ruler
of Egypt. He told him that he had received
word from Heaven ordering him to lead the
people of Israel out into the desert to take part
in a feast.</p>

<p>The cruel Pharaoh did not believe in God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
He was angry with Moses and refused to let
the people go.</p>

<p>Moses now showed the power the Lord had
given him. He lifted his rod and commanded
ten plagues to come down on the land of
Egypt. This was to punish the Pharaoh and
force him to free the Israelites.</p>

<p>One by one the plagues fell upon the
country. The waters were changed to blood,
and great numbers of frogs appeared upon the
land. Besides these creatures, there were
swarms of lice, flies, and other pests.</p>

<p>The people of Egypt became sick. The
land was covered with darkness. The Pharaoh
was frightened and promised to let the Israelites
leave his country. Then the darkness
lifted and the plagues ceased. But as soon as
this happened, the Pharaoh broke his promise.</p>

<p>The troubles began again. Pharaoh made
fresh promises, only to break them again as
soon as the plagues stopped.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, God sent an angel into Egypt to
kill all the first-born of the people. The
Israelites, however, were not to be harmed.
Moses told them to smear their door-posts
with the blood of a lamb.</p>

<p>The angel moved from house to house,
doing as the Lord had directed. But when he
came to a door-post marked with the blood
of a lamb, he passed it by, and no one within
was harmed.</p>

<p>Esther's father told the story that evening,
as though the children had never heard it
before. Yet they had listened to it every year
since they could remember.</p>

<p>The blood of a lamb! Yes, the people in
olden time had good reason to sacrifice a
lamb at the Passover.</p>

<p>It was well named the Passover, in memory
of the angel's passing over the homes of the
Chosen People.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE ORPHAN</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear</span> me! How my head aches," said
Esther. "I do wish those dogs would stop
barking."</p>

<p>The little girl had been ill for two or
three days. The hot days of summer had
brought on a fever. The doctor had said,
"Keep the child quiet. All she needs is
rest. She has played too much in the sunshine."</p>

<p>But how could poor little Esther have
quiet? The street dogs were noisy enough
in the daytime, but when night came, it seemed
as though every single one was wide awake
and quarrelling with his neighbours.</p>

<p>"They have no home, and are almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
obliged to fight, to get enough to eat. I am
sorry for them," said Esther's mother.</p>

<p>She felt more kindly to the dogs than most
of the people in Jerusalem. They would
have been glad to have the city rid of the
creatures.</p>

<p>These street dogs look very much like
foxes. They have no homes of their own and
almost no friends. Those living in one part
of the city are always ready to carry on war
against those of every other part.</p>

<p>"Let us take Esther up on the roof," said
the little girl's father, one evening. "It is
such a hot night, she cannot rest in this close
room."</p>

<p>Esther felt better almost as soon as she had
been carried up and settled on a soft couch.
The roof of the stone house where she lived
was flat. Most of the houses around her
were built in the same way. Many of the
neighbours spent their evenings on the roofs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and often moved from one roof to another to
make calls on each other.</p>

<p>Esther had been up there only a few
minutes before she had a caller. It was a
little girl about her own age. She told Esther
some news about one of their playmates. She
said:</p>

<p>"Only think of it! Miriam's father has
just died. You know, Esther, her mother
died so long ago that she doesn't even remember
her. What will become of her now?
There is no one in the world to take care
of her."</p>

<p>Esther was very fond of Miriam, and her
heart was full of pity.</p>

<p>She thought of her own comfortable home
and then of the many Jews in the city who
were very, very poor. Perhaps Miriam would
become a beggar! It was a dreadful thought.</p>

<p>Just then Esther's mother came up on the
roof. She was dressed in a beautiful yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
robe. A rich girdle belted it in at the waist.
She wore large golden hoops in her ears,
and a heavy chain around her neck.</p>

<p>"Mamma is as lovely as a queen," thought
Esther. "I know papa isn't rich. Still, he
has enough and to spare, and we have many
nice things. I will ask him and mamma to
adopt Miriam. Then I shall have a sister
of my own.</p>

<p>"Mamma, dear, I have just heard about
Miriam, and now I want to ask you something.
Will you take her for your little
daughter?"</p>

<p>The mother sat down beside the sick girl.
Her face wore a gentle smile.</p>

<p>"My dear, I am glad the thought came
to you. You are a sweet, loving child. Do
you know, your father and I have just been
talking about this very thing. There is nothing
our Church praises more highly than the
adoption of an orphan. It is called 'A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
work.' So we have decided to add one more
to our little family."</p>

<p>Esther clapped her hands with joy. "I
know I shall get well at once," she cried.
"The fever will go away, for I sha'n't have
time to think of it."</p>

<p>It was just as she had said. It seemed as
though she began to get better from that very
moment. She had so much to do trying to
entertain her new sister, she did not think of
herself.</p>

<p>Miriam was sad at first. She could not
help remembering she was an orphan. But
her new father and mother were so kind to
her, and Solomon and his sister tried so hard
to make her happy, she soon forgot to be
lonesome and sad.</p>

<p>One day a message came from Rebecca and
Levi. They wished all the children to come
and visit them. Rebecca wrote:</p>

<p>"We have a new pet, and I know you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
be fond of it. It is a beautiful Syrian sheep.
Its wool is a soft brown and yellow. Its tail
is very broad and flat. It is so tame, it follows
me wherever I go.</p>

<p>"Besides," the letter went on, "we have
quantities of fresh figs now, and I know you
children are very fond of them."</p>

<p>"May we go, mother? Please say 'yes,'"
asked Esther.</p>

<p>"If your father is willing," was the answer.
"I shall be very lonesome, but it will do you
all good to leave the city for awhile and visit
our kind friends."</p>

<p>That evening, Esther and Miriam ran to
meet their father.</p>

<p>"I wish father had a little farm," said
Esther, as the two girls walked arm in arm
down the street. "I should think it would be
ever so much easier than being a trader."</p>

<p>"I spoke about that once to my other
father," said thoughtful little Miriam. "He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
said that in the good old times our people
were generally shepherds or farmers. But
nowadays they are almost all traders.</p>

<p>"It is because those who do not believe
as we do have treated us so cruelly. They
have made it hard for us to hold land. We
have been forced to become traders. Our
people are scattered all over the world.
Father said there is hardly a country without
some of them."</p>

<p>"Let us ask papa to tell us stories of old
times to-night," said Esther. "There, I see
his scarlet robe away down the street now."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE JEWS OF LONG AGO</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">May</span> we go to Levi's, papa dear?" asked
Esther, when the evening meal was over and
the children were gathered with their parents
on the housetop. "Mamma said she was
willing, but we must ask you."</p>

<p>"I think it would be very pleasant for you,
and I know Levi and Rebecca like to have
you there. Yes, you may go."</p>

<p>"I knew you would say yes. And now we
want to ask you something else. Will you
tell us some stories of long ago, before our city
was destroyed?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you would like best to hear
about the children, Esther?"</p>

<p>"Of course, papa."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"They were very happy. Their parents
were as wise and tender in caring for them
as they are to-day.</p>

<p>"When they were yet quite young, they
began to study the books of wisdom of our
people. They went to school every day.
There was one saying they heard over and
over again. It was this, 'Be not forgetful to
entertain strangers.'</p>

<p>"'Our houses are not for us alone,' their
parents said, and taught them this beautiful
saying, 'Let thy house be wide open, and let
the poor be the children of the house.'</p>

<p>"There were many pilgrim feasts in those
days. People came to Jerusalem to worship in
the temple and to take part in the sacred festivals.
Yet it is said that not one of these
pilgrims ever felt the need of entertainment.
The houses were open for all.</p>

<p>"Only think of it! It was a common
thing to walk along the street and see curtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hanging in front of the doors. This was a
sign that there was still room for guests.
Some people went so far as to say, 'There
should be four doors to every house. Then
travellers could be welcomed from every
direction.'"</p>

<p>"What kind of houses did the people live
in?" asked Solomon.</p>

<p>"There were small cottages where the poor
lived, for there were some, of course, who did
not have much of this world's goods. Then
there were the houses of the middle class.
These were built of brick or stone. And
besides these there were the elegant marble
homes of the rich, built around beautiful
courtyards.</p>

<p>"The houses had flat roofs paved with stone
or brick. They were made to slant down a
little, so as to let the rain-water run off
through pipes into the cistern below. These
cisterns were needed in the old days just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
as much as now, on account of the long
months when no rain fell and the country became
so dry.</p>

<p>"A railing was built around each housetop.
In this way it was made into a comfortable
resting-place for the family and their friends.
It was cool and quiet."</p>

<p>"We follow the same fashion," said Esther.</p>

<p>"Yes, but in the old times I suppose it was
used even more than now. The older people
often went up there to pray. Meetings were
sometimes held there. It was also a good
place to watch for the enemy.</p>

<p>"The rich people often had wide and
costly stairs built up to the roof from the
street. You can imagine the boys and girls
running over these stairs in a game of chase
or hide-and-seek."</p>

<p>"How did the people of two thousand
years ago furnish their houses?" asked
Miriam.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very much as we do now. They had
couches, chairs and tables, and there were
often many soft cushions for the head and
arms. The people used candlesticks and
lamps, exactly as we do.</p>

<p>"But I promised to talk most about the
children. They took part with their parents
in family prayer every night and morning.
They washed and prayed before every meal.
After it, they gave thanks to God for his
kindness to them. As each Sabbath came
around, the children looked forward to it as
though they were going to welcome a king.
It was a time of rest and joy.</p>

<p>"When the father came home on the eve of
the holy day, he found the house trimmed
up as though for a feast. The Sabbath lamp
was lighted. The table was spread with the
richest feast the family could afford. Before
doing anything else, the father blessed each
child with the blessing of Israel. The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ones felt that something beautiful and holy
was about to take place.</p>

<p>"They were quite willing to give up their
play for the next day. They would have
something better."</p>

<p>"You have taught us all these things, papa,"
said Esther.</p>

<p>"I know it, my dear. But I tell them
again so that you may see we have not changed
much since the old days.</p>

<p>"The children looked forward to the feast-days
with joyful delight. It is hard to say
which they liked best."</p>

<p>"They must have loved the Feast of the
Dedication," said Miriam.</p>

<p>"Why, Miriam?"</p>

<p>"On account of the many candles. It is so
pleasant to watch a great number of them
burning at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, children always love lights and brightness.
The first evening of the feast, a candle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was lighted for each one in the house. The
second evening, two were lighted, and so on to
the eighth night."</p>

<p>"But the Feast of Esther brings more
sport," said Solomon.</p>

<p>"You are just like every other boy, Solomon.
You like noise and fun," said his
father.</p>

<p>"But, think a moment, children. Must
not the Feast of the Passover have been the
greatest one of all?"</p>

<p>"It was then that the father repeated the
whole history of the Children of Israel to his
listening children. They loved to hear it. It
seemed to them as though they were really
following the Chosen People in their wanderings.
They looked upon Moses receiving the
commandments from Heaven. As they shut
their eyes, they saw in their minds the waters
of the Red Sea parting to let the Children
of Israel pass across in safety. Then, again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
coming together, the waves closed over their
enemies and destroyed them."</p>

<p>"Father, you tell us the stories as well as
any one possibly could," said Solomon.</p>

<p>"I do my best, Solomon. But in the
olden days the children were brought nearer
to heaven by their visits to the temple.</p>

<p>"Think of that glorious building and its walls
shining with gold! It seems as though I could
see the throng of white-robed priests and hear
the blasts they sounded on their silver trumpets.</p>

<p>"Listen! A chant from the Psalms rings
through the great building. It sounds like
heavenly voices." Esther's father closed his
eyes and became silent. The children were
filled with awe as they sat quietly beside him.</p>

<p>"I wish I could have lived in the long ago,"
thought Esther. "The temple must have
seemed like a part of heaven brought to earth."</p>

<p>"Now we will repeat the night prayer and
go to rest," said the father.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>QUEER SIGHTS</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Would</span> you like to go shopping with
me?" said Esther's mother, the next afternoon.
"I must buy some things you children
will need to carry with you on your visit."</p>

<p>Esther and Miriam jumped up from their
play. They were always ready to go shopping.
They liked to see the pretty things in
the shops.</p>

<p>Esther's mother had made herself ready for
her walk by fastening a bright red shawl over
her head. She never wore a hat or a bonnet,
as do her American sisters.</p>

<p>"We will go to the market first," she told
the children. "I wish to buy some fruit."</p>

<p>It was quite a long walk, but there was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
much to see on the way, Esther and Miriam
did not think of that.</p>

<p>"Do see that drove of donkeys," exclaimed
their mother, after they had entered one of the
principal streets. "They are laden with goatskins
filled with water, I suppose. Listen,
children! Their Arab driver is calling to
them."</p>

<p>"O-ar! o-ar! derak! derak!" sounded
the driver's voice.</p>

<p>A small boy running down a byway mimicked
the Arab.</p>

<p>"O-ar! o-ar! derak! derak!"</p>

<p>"See that solemn old camel," said Esther.
"He is laden with stones. They must be
very heavy. Poor old fellow! I don't blame
him for growling at his master for trying to
hurry him up."</p>

<p>"His growl rattles so, it seems to come
from his inmost stomach," said the mother,
laughingly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Baksheesh! baksheesh!" yelled a beggar
sitting cross-legged against the wall of a house.
The man was ragged and dirty. He held
a tin pail before him. Kind-hearted people
had dropped money, fruit, and vegetables into
it as they passed by.</p>

<p>"There are many poor people of our own
faith here in the city," said Esther's mother, as
they went on their way. "They really suffer
for lack of food. That man is a Turk. It
may be that he is really as poor as he looks,
and needs all the help he can get. But it
is quite possible he has a comfortable home,
and only begs because it is an easy way of getting
a living."</p>

<p>"Look, mamma, at that woman of Bethlehem,"
said Miriam. "I know her by the
dress."</p>

<p>Miriam pointed to the dark blue robe.
Stripes of bright red, mixed with gold, reached
down the sides. The sleeves were large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
long, and trimmed in the same way. The
woman's white veil hung down from a tall
cap.</p>

<p>"How heavy her cap must be," said Esther.
"It is like a crown."</p>

<p>"All the coins she owns are sewed on her
cap," answered the mother. "It tells every
one just how rich she is."</p>

<p>"I don't see how she does her work if she
wears that robe all the time," said Miriam.
"The sleeves are so large, I should think they
must be in the way."</p>

<p>"She probably ties them together behind her.
I have been told that is the way. She can use
them as pockets."</p>

<p>"I don't see how men ever get used to carrying
such big loads," said Esther.</p>

<p>She pointed to two porters who were bent
nearly double. Their loads were strapped upon
cushions fastened on their backs, and held in
place by straps around their heads.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="a woman with a man sitting on the ground in the background" />
<div class="caption">A WOMAN OF BETHLEHEM.</div>
</div>

<p>"Each of those men must have almost as
much of a load as a camel carries," said Esther's
mother. "It seems almost impossible, but
it is true. It is a hard life, a very hard
life."</p>

<p>While she was speaking they entered the
market. The eyes of the little girls were kept
busy looking at the many different things of
interest.</p>

<p>There were Arabs in charge of camels
laden with melons, grapes and figs. There
were women selling vegetables, and at the
same time taking care of their babies. There
were patient donkeys longing to be freed from
their loads of goods which their masters were
trying to sell.</p>

<p>"Mamma, mamma!" whispered Esther.
"There is a baby gazelle in the basket on
that woman's head. It is even smaller than
the one I saw at Rebecca's. I suppose she
is trying to sell the little thing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br /><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look at the woman beside her," said
Miriam. "She looks very tired. I suppose
she has walked several miles from her own
village with her baskets of fruit. Her baby
boy sits on her shoulders, crowing and laughing
at every one who passes by."</p>

<p>"Come, children. We will go now to
some shops where I must buy things not
sold here," said Esther's mother.</p>

<p>She led the way out of the market and they
entered a crowded street. There were Turks
in their flowing robes, Arabs, Armenians,
Syrians, and Jews. Almost all were gaily
dressed, and many of them were handsome.
The Arabs were either barefooted, or else
they wore red or yellow slippers.</p>

<p>"They lift their feet as though they were
passing over a desert," said Esther to Miriam,
as they went by some Arabs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="narrow street of steps" />
<div class="caption">A STREET IN JERUSALEM.</div>
</div>

<p>"I should think they would suffer from
the heat," answered her sister. "Their heads
look so big, I'm sure they have two or three
caps under their turbans."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they think the more clothing
they wear, the better the heat will be kept
out," said their mother, who heard what they
were talking about.</p>

<p>"Here is the shop I was looking for. We
will go in."</p>

<p>She led the way into a sort of cave cut into
the soft rock. It was a dark, dingy little place.
There were shelves around the sides of it. In
the middle was a sort of counter, where
the storekeeper sat with his goods around
him.</p>

<p>As Esther's mother entered, he slowly took
his pipe from his mouth and stopped his
gossiping with a friend who sat outside on the
pavement. He was in no hurry, however.
He acted more like a king on his throne
than a trader who had to sell cloth for a
living.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yellow plush, is it?" he asked. "Ah! I
have some beautiful, beautiful. It is the very
thing."</p>

<p>But his customer was not easily satisfied,
and after she had finally picked out the piece
she wished, there was a long talk about the
price. Both were satisfied at last. The plush
was cut off and wrapped up, and the storekeeper
was left to his own pleasure.</p>

<p>Esther's mother still had some errands to
do, so they visited several other stores. They
were not all in caves, however, but most of
them were small and dark.</p>

<p>At last, everything needed was purchased
and the lady and children started homeward.</p>

<p>"Look at the sky," said Esther. "Isn't it
beautiful to-night?"</p>

<p>The sun was almost setting. The clouds
were turning a rosy red. They were so bright
that the city itself seemed to share in their
glory.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jerusalem the Blessed!" said Miriam, in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"There is papa. We are late about getting
home and so is he," said Esther. "Now we
can have his company."</p>

<p>Her father had already seen his wife and
the girls, and was smiling at them.</p>

<p>It was a warm evening, yet he wore his
fur-trimmed, round velvet hat over the
tight-fitting cap that never left his head in
the daytime. A long lock of hair hung down
on each side of his face, as it always did after
he was dressed for the day.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my little ones," he said, as Esther
and Miriam each seized a hand. "Now tell me
what you have seen while you were shopping."</p>

<p>The children chattered as they do everywhere
in the world. They described the market and
the people, the camels and the shopkeepers.</p>

<p>"We were coming to your store when we
found how late it was. Then we thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
would be closed, and you on your way home.
And so you were," said Esther, laughingly.</p>

<p>By the time the children had reached their
own door, they were so tired they thought only
of bed and sleep. They were even too tired
to care about their supper.</p>

<p>"But you must not slight your night prayer,"
said their father, soberly.</p>

<p>Esther's and Miriam's eyes winked and
blinked a good many times before they got
through the prayer.</p>

<p>"It never seemed so long before, except
when I was sick," Esther told her adopted
sister, when they were at last stretched on their
beds. "And, do you know, Miriam," she
added, sleepily, "I believe Solomon doesn't
always repeat it all. He says our people have
so many prayers he gets tired of them sometimes.
Isn't that dreadful?"</p>

<p>But Miriam was already sound asleep, and
did not answer.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CAVE</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Which</span> way did you come?" asked Levi,
as he helped the two little girls down from the
ass's back. Solomon had walked by their side
all the way.</p>

<p>"We passed through the Jaffa gate and then
took the shortest way down here into the valley,"
said Esther.</p>

<p>Jerusalem is surrounded by walls. There
are seven gates through which the city may be
entered or left. But the Jaffa and Damascus
gates are the ones most used.</p>

<p>"We saw a Bedouin riding a beautiful horse.
He was in full dress, and looked just elegant,"
said Solomon. "I should like to own a horse
like his."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me how he was dressed," said
Rebecca.</p>

<p>"His long, wide cloak must have been
quite new. I could tell, because the yellow
stripes looked so clean and bright. The shawl
bound around his head and hanging down over
his shoulders was pure white," said Miriam.</p>

<p>"His high red leather boots were the handsomest
part of his dress. There were tassels
at the sides, of course," interrupted Solomon.
"But his sash! You ought to have seen the
shining dagger and the pistol that were stuck
in it. My! the man looked as though he
were ready to meet any one.</p>

<p>"His horse was a beauty, too. She was
decked with red woollen tassels that reached
clear to the ground. She snorted and stepped
off with the spirit of a war-horse. You know
the tassels are useful in keeping off the flies.
There are such swarms of them the poor beasts
suffer very much."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="man sitting on horse" />
<div class="caption">A BEDOUIN.</div>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"But come along, children, I know you
want to have a romp under the trees. You
need not stay here talking any longer."</p>

<p>While Levi was speaking, Rebecca put her
arm around Miriam's waist and tried to make
her feel at home. She had not been to Jerusalem
since the little orphan had come to live
with Esther and Solomon.</p>

<p>"She is a sweet child," she thought. "Not
as strong as Esther nor as brave as Solomon.
But she will be grateful for kindness. I feel
sure of that when I look into her eyes."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Rebecca and Levi were
playing with their young company as though
they were children themselves.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we will have a little picnic,
and I will take you to a cave you have never
visited," promised Levi, as his young visitors
were bidding him good night.</p>

<p>"It is a pleasant walk there, and not so far
as to tire us," added Rebecca.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning was bright and clear.
The breakfast was soon eaten, after which,
Esther and Miriam helped Rebecca clean up
the house and prepare the lunch they were to
carry.</p>

<p>While they were waiting for Levi and Solomon
to finish some farm work, the little girls
had a chance to pet the gazelle and the
tame sheep of which Rebecca had written
them.</p>

<p>At last they were all ready to start. It was
a pleasant walk, as Rebecca had said, yet there
were several rough and rather wild places to
pass through.</p>

<p>"Almost all the caves around here are made
of limestone," said Levi. "It is so soft that
the rains wear great hollows in the rocks."</p>

<p>"Did you ever go to the cave of Adullam,
Levi?" asked Solomon.</p>

<p>"Yes, once when I was a boy. It is
beyond Bethlehem. I had heard father speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of it. He told me that King David hid there
with four hundred of his followers."</p>

<p>"Four hundred! It must be a very big
cave, then," said Esther.</p>

<p>"You would think so, if you once got
inside. There is one hall that is thirty-eight
yards long. There are several passages leading
into it. Some are so low that one has
to crawl through them on his hands and knees.
Others spread out into large chambers. Many
of these chambers are very beautiful. The
water has trickled down the walls and worn
the soft limestone into the loveliest patterns."</p>

<p>"How could you see, Levi? wasn't it dark
inside the cave?" asked Solomon.</p>

<p>"Of course it was, but every one in the
party carried a lighted torch or candle. The
torches gave light enough to show the beautiful
ornaments."</p>

<p>"There is our own cave ahead of us," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Rebecca. "Of course I mean it is the one we
are to visit," she added, with a laugh.</p>

<p>All the children could see was a great mass
of rocks on the side of a hill. As they drew
nearer, they spied a small hole near the
ground.</p>

<p>"Must we crawl through that hole?" asked
Esther, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"It is larger than you imagine," replied
Levi. "Besides, you only have to crawl a
few feet. After that the way opens up quite
suddenly. I will go first with my torch.
Then you can all follow."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," Miriam whispered to Esther.
She did not wish Solomon to hear her. She
feared he would make fun of her.</p>

<p>"Hold on to my hand and have courage.
I will go ahead of you," was the answer.</p>

<p>One by one, they passed through the
opening.</p>

<p>"Isn't this fun!" cried Solomon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
all stood in the chamber worn out of the
rocks.</p>

<p>"It makes me feel queer to think of being
underground," said Esther.</p>

<p>"Hark! What's that noise?" said Miriam,
in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>"It's only a family of bats we have taken
by surprise. They are not used to callers,"
said Levi.</p>

<p>The bats were more frightened than Miriam.
They flew about in a blind way. Several
times they almost brushed against the faces
of Rebecca and Levi, the tallest ones in the
party.</p>

<p>"Ugh! I don't like bats," said Miriam.
"I am going outside."</p>

<p>"Just wait a minute until I see if there are
any pretty decorations on the walls. Look!
Here is just what I was searching for."</p>

<p>Levi held his torch up near the roof.</p>

<p>"Isn't it beautiful? How can Nature work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in such a regular pattern?" said Rebecca, half
to herself.</p>

<p>"It is because she is the handmaiden of
the Lord," replied Levi, reverently.</p>

<p>After they had left the cave and were once
more out in the bright sunshine, the children
were allowed to choose a place for the picnic
dinner. They had brought water for bathing
the hands and face as well as for drinking.
Levi had told them before they started that
there was no well or spring near the place.</p>

<p>After they had washed and prayed, they
were all ready to enjoy the nice luncheon
Rebecca had prepared.</p>

<p>"Tell us stories about King David, won't
you, please Levi?" asked Solomon. "When
you spoke of the cave of Adullam this morning
you said David hid there with a great
many of his followers. I suppose that made
me think of him now."</p>

<p>"I should like nothing better," said Levi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
stretching himself out on the ground. "But
would you all like to hear about the 'Sweet
Singer of Israel'?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we would," sounded a chorus of
voices.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE SWEET SINGER OF ISRAEL</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Very</span> well, then. Let us go back to
the days of long ago, long, even, before the
destruction of our beloved city. Let us seek
David on the hillsides, tending his flocks with
loving care.</p>

<p>"One day a visitor came to the house of
Jesse, David's father. This visitor was no
other than the prophet Samuel. He had
received a command from the Lord telling
him to take a vial of oil and seek the house
of Jesse.</p>

<p>"'There,' said the Lord, 'you will find
the new king who is to succeed Saul.'</p>

<p>"Samuel hastened to obey. When he
reached Jesse's house, he asked to see his sons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
One by one passed before him till the eighth
son, David, appeared. Then the voice of the
Lord again spoke to Samuel. It said:</p>

<p>"'Arise, anoint him, for this is he.'</p>

<p>"As soon as the prophet had anointed
David with the oil, the young man was filled
with the spirit and power of God. At the
same time, they left King Saul, who did many
foolish and bad deeds after this.</p>

<p>"But what of David? Did he go out into
the world and declare himself the future king
of Israel? Not so. He continued to live his
peaceful, quiet life as a shepherd. He learned
to sing, and play upon the harp. He now
showed himself indeed the 'Sweet Singer of
Israel.'</p>

<p>"He began to show power in other ways,
too. Many times the fierce lions and savage
bears came creeping upon his flocks. Many
times David met and overpowered them with
the strength given to him by the Lord."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems as though I can see him guarding
his flocks," said Solomon, as Levi stopped
talking to rest for a moment. "His beautiful
black eyes are looking out into the night and
watching for danger. He looks at his sleeping
sheep to see if all are safe. Then he hears
the sound of foes drawing near and springs to
meet them."</p>

<p>"I like best to think of him with a tiny
lamb in his arms," said Esther. "He holds
it lovingly against his breast, as though he
would say, 'I will save you from all harm,
poor, helpless creature.'"</p>

<p>Levi now went on with his story.</p>

<p>"While David was still tending his flocks,
King Saul was waging war upon the Philistines,
the bitter enemies of our people. They
became more and more daring, until at last
they gathered on the side of a mountain right
here in Israel.</p>

<p>"Three of David's brothers were fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in Saul's army and went out to meet the
Philistines. David often went to the camp to
visit his brothers. He happened to be there
once when a Philistine giant marched forth
and dared any Israelite to fight with him.</p>

<p>"There was no one who felt able to say, 'I
am not afraid; I accept your challenge.'</p>

<p>"'No one,' did I say? At first, this was
true, for every one in Saul's army kept silent.
But when David saw this, he felt the spirit
of the Lord stir within him. He arose, saying,
'I will meet you.'</p>

<p>"He was now led before Saul, and there, in
the presence of the king, he said he had faith
that God would save him from harm, even
from the hand of the giant. At first, Saul
thought:</p>

<p>"'It is of no use for this young shepherd
to go out alone to meet the giant. He will
only lose his life.'</p>

<p>"But when he heard what David said, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
changed his mind. He got out a strong suit
of armour, and even helped him to put it on.
David was not used to such things. The
armour weighed him down so that he staggered
and almost fell. He said:</p>

<p>"'It would be better for me to carry only
such weapons as I know. Let me take my
shepherd's staff and the sling I have used so
often in meeting the wild beasts.'</p>

<p>"He was allowed to do as he chose. He
went forth to meet the giant with nothing to
help him save his staff and sling.</p>

<p>"And what did the giant, Goliath, say when
he saw the young shepherd draw near? He
spoke in scornful words. But he suddenly
became silent as David sent a stone from his
sling that passed through his forehead and
entered his brain. As soon as David saw the
success of his shot, he rushed to the giant's
side, seized his sword, and cut off his head.</p>

<p>"The watching Philistines were filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fear. They began to flee. But Saul's army
followed and overtook them and killed great
numbers.</p>

<p>"All Israel now began to praise David.
Saul, too, was filled with delight. He declared
he was willing David should marry his elder
daughter after a while.</p>

<p>"Now the king, as you know, often did
wild and foolish things. This was, perhaps,
because he gave way to fits of bad temper.
When he learned of David's power to play and
sing, he often asked the young shepherd to
quiet his angry feelings with the sweet music
of his harp and voice.</p>

<p>"He was very fond of David in those days,
but after a while he became jealous when he
heard the constant praises of the people.
They said, 'Saul hath slain his thousands,
but David his ten thousands.'</p>

<p>"His anger was now turned against the
brave shepherd. At one time, he threw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
spear at David. It was when the lad was
playing on his harp. But Saul failed to do
what his wicked heart desired. The Lord
was protecting the future king of Israel.</p>

<p>"Again he tried to kill David, and again he
failed. Saul must have thought that it was of
no use, so now he sought to injure the young
man in a different way. He gave the
daughter he had promised David to another
lover.</p>

<p>"But Saul soon found that his younger
daughter loved David. He now said:</p>

<p>"'You may have Michal if you will first
kill one hundred Philistines.' He only said
this because he hoped David would be killed
by the enemy."</p>

<p>"I know what David did," exclaimed Solomon,
who could keep still no longer. "He
went out and destroyed two hundred Philistines,
instead of one hundred."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Levi, "and he brought back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the spoils and laid them at the feet of Saul.
The king was now obliged to have David for
a son-in-law. But he hated him as much as
ever.</p>

<p>"So he told his son Jonathan and some of
his attendants to kill him. Now Jonathan, as
you must know, loved David as a brother.
He did all in his power to make his father
feel more kindly toward him. He had almost
succeeded, when Saul was seized with a new
spirit of madness. All his wicked feelings
came back, and he hired some bad men to
take David by surprise when he was asleep,
and kill him.</p>

<p>"Somehow or other, Michal heard of the
plot. She warned David, and he fled from the
palace. But Michal did not stop here. She
made the shape of a man and placed it in
David's bed. In this way the bad men who
came to kill him were deceived.</p>

<p>"I am rather tired, Rebecca," said Levi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
when he had got this far in his story.
"Won't you go on and tell the children about
David's flight?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said his wife. In her sweet,
clear voice she made a picture of David hiding
near Ramah. "But he was not safe, for Saul
heard where he was. He sent men there to
take him prisoner. A strange thing happened
on their way. They were overcome by the
spirit of the Lord, and they did not dare seize
David.</p>

<p>"When Saul was told how they had failed,
he went himself in search of David. But he,
too, was overpowered by the spirit of the
Lord. And what do you think happened?
Instead of harming him, he asked David to
come back to the palace.</p>

<p>"But David did not feel sure that Saul was
a true friend. He thought it would be the
wisest thing for him to see Jonathan first and
ask him to find out how his father really felt.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jonathan was a true friend. It did not
take him long to learn that Saul was as much
an enemy as ever. He must now let David
know about it, and prevent his return to
the palace. He knew where David was
hiding, but he did not dare seek him
out.</p>

<p>"Instead of that, he started from the palace
to go shooting. He took a boy with him.
When he had come close to the place where
his friend was hidden, he began to shoot. He
spoke to the boy from time to time. He used
such words as to let the listening David know
that the king was no more his friend than
ever."</p>

<p>When Rebecca had got thus far, Miriam
looked a little perplexed.</p>

<p>"I don't see how David could understand
what he meant," she said.</p>

<p>"He had agreed with Jonathan that certain
words should mean certain things, my dear."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I see now. Go on with the story,
please."</p>

<p>Rebecca smiled pleasantly, and went on.</p>

<p>"David prepared to flee at once. But he
had no arms or food. He must have both.</p>

<p>"He went to the house of the High Priest.
When he had entered, he told him he had
come with a message from the king. He
asked for the sword of Goliath, which was in
the High Priest's keeping. He also asked for
five sacred loaves of shewbread, which no one
dared to eat except the priests.</p>

<p>"When these had been given him he
hurried away. He had one adventure after
another. It was about this time that he hid
in the cave of Adullam. His brothers and
a great many other Israelites joined him there.</p>

<p>"While he was hiding in the cave of Adullam,
the prophet of God came to him, telling
him to go into the land of Judah. He started
at once to obey the prophet's command. Saul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
heard where he was and followed him. On
his way, the king heard how David had been
helped by the High Priest. He was so angry
that he ordered not only the High Priest to
be killed, but also his eighty-five helpers, and
all the people of the town in which he lived.</p>

<p>"The son of the High Priest managed
to escape. He fled to David and told him
the sad story. You can imagine how bad
David felt when he learned what had happened
through his own deceit. But his mind
was kept busy with plans to keep out of Saul's
reach, for the king followed him from place to
place.</p>

<p>"One night while David was hiding in a
cave, the king stopped to rest at that very
spot. Little did he dream who was so near
him. While he lay sleeping David crept to
his side and cut off a piece of his cloak. He
might have killed Saul at this time, but he had
too great a heart.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"The next day, just as the king was riding
away in his chariot, David appeared in the
mouth of the cave. He held up the piece he
had cut from Saul's cloak. Then the king
knew he had been in David's power. He saw
how generously he had been treated. He
felt such shame that he determined to do
the young man no more harm. But his
heart soon grew wicked again and once more
he began to persecute him.</p>

<p>"David again showed him how generous
he was. He crept into Saul's tent one night.
The king's army was encamped all around
him. Only a servant went with David on
this dangerous trip.</p>

<p>"No one saw them as they stole along.
No one heard them as David stepped to the
side of the sleeping Saul and seized his spear
and cup; then away they sped till they reached
the hilltop opposite the one where Saul had
taken his stand.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"David now cried out in a loud voice to wake
the sleeping army. He showed the cup and
spear he had taken away from Saul's tent.
Saul saw that David had spared his life
a second time. He was again filled with
gratitude.</p>

<p>"But David had learned not to trust him.
He sought a home among the Philistines and
helped them in their wars. They treated him
with great kindness and their king became
his true friend.</p>

<p>"Not long after this, the Philistines went
out to battle against Saul. David was not with
them at this time. It was a sad day for the
Israelites. They were badly beaten and Saul's
sons were killed. Yes, even David's faithful
friend Jonathan lost his life. Saul was overcome
with sorrow. He threw himself upon
his sword and died by his own hand.</p>

<p>"When David heard the news he felt very
sad. He mourned bitterly over the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Jonathan. But this could not be helped
now, and there was much work to do for his
people.</p>

<p>"The Israelites were in a pitiful state. The
Philistines had most of the country in their
power. A leader was needed. That leader
was at hand. It was David, the hero, the
Sweet Singer.</p>

<p>"'How just he is!' said the people. 'How
brave he is!' all cried.</p>

<p>"Not long after this he was crowned King
of Israel. At first, he lived in Hebron, but
afterward he went to Jerusalem, where a beautiful
palace was built for him and his family.
And now he went on and became great, for
the Lord God of hosts was with him."</p>

<p>Rebecca bowed her head as she said these
words.</p>

<p>"Let us chant one of the psalms of David,"
said Levi. "It is a good way to end our
afternoon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Rebecca began the words of the beautiful
twenty-third psalm. The others joined their
voices with hers.</p>
